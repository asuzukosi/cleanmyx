# Twitter Controversy Analyzer

This is a Twitter/X analysis tool that searches a user's profile for tweets containing controversial keywords and uses AI to analyze whether those tweets are controversial. The tool searches through tweets matching 20 predefined controversial keywords, analyzes each matching tweet using OpenAI's language model to determine controversy levels, and outputs detailed results to both the console and a JSON file for further analysis.
